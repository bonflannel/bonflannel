## About our corn cozies

Growing up on a farm in the north, the nights were long and cold when the snow drifted high. It was so cozy to crawl into bed with a sack of hot corn. During the day, a large pan of field corn was placed under the wood-burning stove in the kitchen. At night, the corn was put into pillowcases or flour sacks and given to each family member. Every morning the corn was returned to the pan to be heated again. 

Your corn sack will not only warm your bed, but soothe your tired, aching muscles, too. And you can heat it again in the morning to keep you warm in your vehicle. There is nothing magical about your corn sack; just good old fashioned nostalgia and a few pounds of field corn.

Corn cozies can be heated by microwaving or put in the freezer for a cold compress. A removable slip cover allows for laundering when it becomes soiled.
