about:
  content: Bonjour Creations is a family-run business based in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Both Rose and Edmond grew up in the American corn belt on family farms and continue to work in agricultural education. Working full time keeps them busy, but the craft business provides a creative outlet and another way to interact with the community. Their kids grew up helping out and have continued woodworking and sewing as hobbies.
